# M4 Challenge

## Overview

The provided JavaScript code conducts a comprehensive financial analysis based on a dataset named finances, containing monthly Profit/Loss data spanning from January 2010 to February 2017. Through iteration and calculation, it determines key financial metrics including the total number of months, net total amount of Profit/Losses, average change in Profit/Losses, greatest increase, and greatest decrease in Profit/Losses. The script outputs these metrics to the console for detailed examination and dynamically updates specific elements in an HTML document with the calculated values, allowing users to view the financial analysis results directly on a webpage. This analysis facilitates a deeper understanding of the financial trends and performance over the specified time period.
